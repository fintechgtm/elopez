      A story about finding yourself in your early 20s

<article style="margin-top: 30px;">
<blockquote>
<p>"Youth is wasted on the young." - George Bernard Shaw</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the Road is a love letter to the Beat Generation and the enduring allure of the open road. There's an undercurrent of disillusionment and a realization that the pursuit of freedom can be a double-edged sword. It's a story that simultaneously romanticizes and critiques the restlessness and naivete of your early 20s.</p>
<p>The book is about a frenetic journey through post-World War II America (and briefly Mexico). It&rsquo;s also about wanderlust, self-discovery, and rebellion. The protagonist, Sal Paradise, is an aspiring writer who seeks inspiration and adventure in a world that seems mundane and stifling. It is only when he meets his enigmatic partner in crime, Dean Moriarty, that his left gets &ldquo;exciting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As Sal and Dean zigzag across the country, they meet some colorful characters, each with their own stories and dreams. Their journey is fueled by jazz, stereotypical beatnik slang, poetry, and the raw energy of their generation's desire to stick it to the man.</p>
<p>But as they hurtle from one wild escapade to another, the cracks begin to show in their friendship, and the reality of their lives becomes harder to escape.</p>
<h2><strong>Characters</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sal Paradise:</strong> The introspective, aspiring writer who craves adventure and self-discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Dean Moriarty:</strong> The unpredictable free spirit (and sketchy) friend who inspires Sal.</li>
<li><strong>Carlo Marx:</strong> A poet and friend of Sal and Dean, representative of the Beat Generation.</li>
<li><strong>Marylou, Camille, and Ed Dunkel:</strong> Companions and lovers of Dean.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The open road is both a symbol of freedom and a metaphor for the search for meaning.</li>
<li>Friendships can be exhilarating, volatile, and ultimately transformative.</li>
<li>The allure of living in the moment can overshadow the consequences of our actions.</li>
<li>The pursuit of self-discovery is a universal human experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>I felt old reading this. Sure, the nostalgia and spirit of youth have their charm, but I was increasingly annoyed with the characters and their adventure. Sal and Dean's friendship was an absolute trainwreck. Their companions were more like enablers of their reckless and selfish behavior. Dean was a walking disaster, pulling off some of the most outrageously awful stunts and leaving a trail of chaos in his wake.</p>
<p>The whole trip reeked of desperation, as if they were frantically trying to cling to some fleeting sense of freedom and enlightenment that always seemed just out of reach. As for Sal, I found him to be super unlikable. His blind admiration for Dean and his refusal to see the damage they were causing left me shaking my head.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn't help but feel that the story was less about the romance of the open road and more about a group of lost souls making a series of terrible decisions while deluding themselves into thinking they were on some profound journey of self-discovery.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendation</strong></h2>
<p>If you're looking for a trip down the memory lane (and you&rsquo;re a white guy), maybe this is your type of book. Kerouac's work is considered a classic, so if you're curious about the Beat Generation or interested in crossing it off your list, maybe it's worth giving it a shot.</p>
<p>But I can't recommend it. I think it&rsquo;s overhyped. Overall, I was left feeling more annoyed than inspired. Solid 2/10 for me. Sorry?</p>
<h2>Some <strong>quotes from the story</strong></h2>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll like these, but personally I think these quotes show exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about in the above sections. Big eye roll energy from me here:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road.&rdquo;</li>
<li>"I was halfway across America, at the dividing line between the East of my youth and the West of my future."</li>
<li>&ldquo;There was nowhere to go but everywhere, so just keep on rolling under the stars."</li>
<li>"Our battered suitcases were piled on the sidewalk again; we had longer ways to go. But no matter, the road is life."</li>
</ul>
