A Brave New World: A Dystopian Vision of Utopia
  </h1>
</div>
<article style="margin-top: 30px;">

<p>In A Brave New World, Aldous Huxley paints a vivid picture of a dystopian society where pleasure and conformity reign supreme. The novel is set in a future society where the government has complete control over its citizens through science and technology. Reproduction is controlled and individuals are conditioned to accept their predetermined roles in society.</p>
<p>The story follows the character of Bernard Marx, who is an outsider in the society and is unhappy with the way things are. He begins to question the values of the society, but gives up on that in the end.</p>
<p>I read this book just a few weeks after reading 1984, and this was like a gentle breeze compared to a stormy gale of Orwell&rsquo;s 1984. In hindsight, reading them so close together made it harder to fully appreciate A Brave New World as one of the pioneering classics in dystopian literature.</p>
<p>Like many other books of this genre from the early 20th century, the novel explores the dangers of totalitarian government. But whereas 1984 delves into the darker aspects of communism and socialism through a surveillance state, A Brave New World explores the darker side of technology and consumerism.</p>
<p>A huge difference between the two is that in 1984, the characters are aware of the control imposed upon them, and some even resented it enough to rebel and plot against the government. But in A Brave New World, the citizens have been taught to optimize for maximum happiness rather than loyalty to the government, making it difficult for them to rebel, as they believe they already have what they want.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s easy to rise against oppression when you&rsquo;re deprived of searching for true happiness. But if you believe you&rsquo;ve already found it, what is there to rebel against but rebellion itself?</p>
<p>One of the most striking aspects of the novel is the elimination of the traditional family structure. The government claims that it allows for the needs of the collective to be met without the distractions of individual and kin. Even the idea of motherhood is looked down upon, seen as a shameful and repugnant thing.</p>
<p>Family plays a critical role in shaping our values and our very selves. With the absence of family and social bonds, how else would the society have values without programming? Regardless, I think one of the shortcomings of the novel is it brings all of this up, yet doesn't even fully explore the consequences of the lack of family ties.</p>
<p>Another striking aspect was the problematic portrayal of women and minorities. The women in the novel are portrayed as shallow pleasure seekers, such as the character of Lenina Crowne who is unable to think for herself, only thinks about getting high and having sex, and is fully indoctrinated in the values of the society. The non-white characters are depicted as primitive and inferior.</p>
<p>Most of the book centers around the different methods the government employs to control society, which includes eliminating the family structure, programming children through classical and operant conditioning, exiling citizens that exhibit too much individuality, limiting access to information, and discouraging emotional bonds between citizens.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I don&rsquo;t think I liked the book that much. I found the ending unsatisfying and thought the characters were not well developed. They're mostly just vehicles for the author to explore his ideas and themes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was still an interesting read. It made me wonder about some pretty deep questions: is it better to be happy or to be free? Does freedom lose its allure if it comes at the cost of a life of joy? Is it worth being happy if you are deprived of free will?</p>
<p>But I guess if a book makes you think that deeply, it cannot be all that bad.</p>
<h2>Interesting quotes from the book</h2>
<ol>
<li>"Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly -- they'll go through anything. You read and you're pierced."</li>
<li>&ldquo;Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If one's different, one's bound to be lonely.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.&rdquo;</li>
<li>"But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin."</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never put off till tomorrow the fun you can have today.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;When people are suspicious with you, you start being suspicious with them.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That is the secret of happiness and virtue -- liking what you've got to do.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray.&rdquo;</li>
