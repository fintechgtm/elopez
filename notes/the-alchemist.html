    Rediscovering my Personal Legend: A Review of Coelho's The Alchemist
  </h1>
</div>
<article style="margin-top: 30px;">

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It's true that everything has its Personal Legend, but one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has to transform itself into something better, and to acquire a new Personal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one thing only.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is celebration of the human spirit, a story that tugs at your heart strings and inspires you to go after your personal legend. It follows the journey of Santiago, a shepherd boy who dreams of a life beyond the pasture. After consulting with a fortune teller about a recurring dream he keeps having, he decides to embark on a journey to discover a hidden treasure and along the way, he discovers himself.</p>
<p>Throughout the story, Santiago encounters many characters and situations that put his courage to the test, broaden his perspective, and teach him valuable lessons about love, bravery, and the power of listening to your heart. While he does end up finding an actual treasure, I think the true treasure was actually the person he becomes as a result of his adventures.</p>
<p>This book holds a special place in my heart. It&rsquo;s been a constant source of inspiration for me at different stages of my life. As a teenager, it filled me with hope and excitement. In my 20s, it challenged me to prove myself to the world and gave me the courage to transform into the person I wanted to be. Which was not a particularly easy thing to do for someone who grew up in the 90s and was very afraid of &ldquo;selling out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now in my 30s, it reminds me to never give up and to hold onto the dreams of my past. As a father, I found myself relating to Santiago's struggle to balance his journey with the comfort of stability in the Oasis. After Marcos was born, my priorities changed and I found there were just some things I wasn&rsquo;t willing to do anymore to achieve my goals (e.g. working long hours, putting up with high amounts of stress, giving up my weekends to take on extra projects).</p>
<p>Honestly, I just want to be a huge part of my son&rsquo;s life for as long as I can. I want him to know that I&rsquo;ll always be there for him and I think the best way I can do that is by being physically present and spending a lot of time building a deep connection with him. That&rsquo;s been my number one priority for the last four years, something way more important to me than any personal legend has ever been.</p>
<p>Reading this book was really healthy for me because it reminded me to find balance. As much as I want to be there for my son, I also want him to grow up knowing that he&rsquo;s capable of achieving anything life and that his dreams are within reach if he&rsquo;s willing to pursue them. I think it&rsquo;s important that I do that by living life to the fullest and never giving up on my personal legend.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s easier said than done. It&rsquo;s taken me the better part of two years to get to the point where I can have that realization. I didn&rsquo;t realize how much of an impact the pandemic had on my mental health until it was too late. After feeling lost in depression for a bit, I&rsquo;m grateful to be feeling like my normal self again. I am back to exercising, eating healthy, writing, and taking big swings towards my goals.</p>
<p>This book came back into my life at the exact right time. It&rsquo;s reconnected me with the passion for live I felt in my 20s and I once again feel driven to pursue my personal legend, this time while balancing the responsibilities to my family.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s true what the author says in the book: &ldquo;When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.&rdquo; This past year, I worked really hard to get myself back on track physically and mentally. Perhaps reading this book was the universe&rsquo;s way of throwing me a bone and giving me the inspiration I needed to get me through that last little bump.</p>
<p>And so, as I reflect upon the book, I&rsquo;m reminded to reach for the stars and never give up on my dream. If you find yourself feeling as lost as I did after the pandemic, I hope you rediscover the love, joy, and peace within so that when you look back on your life, you can do so with pride knowing that you weathered to storms, as Santiago did, and emerged strong and wiser for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with this poem I was inspired to write (don't laugh at me lol):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So let the journey continue, for the road ahead is long and winding</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With the wind at our backs and the fire in our hearts, let us march on</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For the true treasure lies not in the destination, but in the journey itself</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With each step, we forge new paths and uncover hidden riches within</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With each breath, we grow stronger and wiser, our spirits lifted higher</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For life is a grand adventure, a never-ending quest for truth and beauty</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>So let us sing with the birds, dance with the stars, and bask in the sun</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For the journey is ours, and the journey is glorious</em></p>
</blockquote>
