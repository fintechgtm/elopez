    The Absurdity of Life: A Review of Camus' The Stranger
  </h1>
</div>
<article style="margin-top: 30px;">

<p>The Stranger by Camus delves into the nature of existentialism and the human condition. The story follows Meursault, a detached and apathetic protagonist, as he navigates through a series of events that ultimately lead to his trial and execution for murder.</p>
<p>I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated with Meursault. While I understood the reason for his detachment and apathy, I still found it so annoying and it made it difficult for me to connect with him as a character.</p>
<p>Also he seems quite clueless. For example, he seems to be under the impression that he and his mother had an understanding and that she did not hold any ill feelings toward him for putting her in a home. Yet, the caretaker seems to disprove that by noting that Meursault&rsquo;s mother had expressed anger and sadness about being in the home.</p>
<p>Above all else, I think his passivity was the characteristic about Meursault that I found most frustrating. Instead of speaking up for himself and explaining the circumstances that led to the killing, Meursault allows the prosecution to define him and his actions. Instead of telling the judge that the Arab had cut his friend and threatened him with a knife, he gives flimsy excuse about the sun being too bright. Why?! This passivity ultimately leads to his conviction and death sentence.</p>
<p>I know the detachment is a central theme of the novel and is used to explore the idea of the absurd, which is a key concept in Camus's philosophy. The absurd is the idea that life has no inherent meaning, and that individuals must create their own purpose. But Meursault's detachment is such a hyperbolic representation of this idea!</p>
<p>Another important theme in the book is the concept of freedom. Meursault is a character who is not constrained by societal norms and expectations, and he acts according to his own desires and impulses. But his freedom is both a blessing and a curse. He lives a life that&rsquo;s true to himself, but also leads to his downfall.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the more interesting part of the novel for me, as it raised an important question about the relationship between freedom and responsibility. Can true freedom exist without consequences?</p>
<p>In the end, Meursault is confronted with his impending execution and is forced to confront his lack of emotions towards his mother's death, and his failure to fully understand the nature of their relationship. This realization brings him a sense of remorse and regret. It&rsquo;s poetic that it took the loss of his own life for him to appreciate the value, and meaning, of living.</p>
<p>Overall, I found The Stranger was a thought-provoking and powerful novel. In his simple and straightforward writing style, Camus masterfully explores the nature of existence, freedom, and the meaning of life. His writing alone makes this book a must read. I plan to read it again in my 40s to see if I still see the world, and Meursault, in the same way.</p>
<h2>Memorable quotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>"Everything I had said, everything I had done, suddenly became meaningless. All that remained was the evidence of a senseless crime.&rdquo;</li>
<li>"I felt as if I had been awakened from a long sleep, a sleep full of dreams, but this morning I was coming back to reason.&rdquo;</li>
<li>"I looked at the sea, at the sky, at the clouds, and I felt that I was going to die for the first time.&rdquo;</li>
<li>"The sun was coming up and the sky was turning red. I had the strange feeling that I'd been happy and that I was happy again.&rdquo;</li>
