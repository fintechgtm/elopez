    The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Book Review: "Space Travel Meets Alice in Wonderland"
  </h1>
</div>
<article style="margin-top: 30px;">
<p>I just finished reading "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and thought it was a fun and enjoyable read. I had trouble getting into the story at first because I didn't realize it was a satire on the sci-fi genre. But once I understood that, I found it much more enjoyable. If you&rsquo;re looking for a deep read or traditional sci-fi, this isn&rsquo;t it. But it is a great choice for a laugh or two.</p>
<p>The story is about a guy named Arthur Dent who gets swept up on a wild adventure through space with his friend Ford Prefect. It's kind of like a space-travel version of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and borrows elements from other popular sci-fi stories. For example, there&rsquo;s a depressed robot named Marvin that is a parody of C3PO from Star Wars. Even "The Guide" itself is a gag on the "Encyclopedia Galactica" from the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>Despite it being a fun story, I think it&rsquo;s a bit overhyped. It&rsquo;s got a cult following and often recommended as a must-read, but I don&rsquo;t think it lives up to the hype. It&rsquo;s the type of book you pick up just for fun, probably as a teenager. The characters are likable, there&rsquo;s a few plot twists, and it&rsquo;s got some clever jokes. But it doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of depth or a strong plot.</p>
<h2>Fun quotes from the story</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I'd far rather be happy than right any day.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I don't want to die now!" he yelled. "I've still got a headache! I don't want to go to heaven with a headache, I'd be all cross and wouldn't enjoy it!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well the hours are good...' ... 'but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
