<p>&ldquo;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms&mdash;to choose one&rsquo;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&rsquo;s own way.&rdquo;―&nbsp;<strong>Viktor E. Frankl,&nbsp;Man's Search for Meaning</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"1984" by George Orwell is a haunting, brilliantly crafted dystopian novel that takes readers on a chilling journey into the depths of a totalitarian society, where an omnipresent government exercises absolute control over every aspect of its citizens' lives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Through its narrative, Orwell masterfully explores the consequences of unchecked power, the perversion of language, and the erosion of individual freedom, leaving readers with a profound and unsettling vision of a world devoid of privacy, truth, and humanity. The book&rsquo;s timeless themes still resonate even 74 years after it was first written.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Characters</span></h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Winston Smith:</span><span> The protagonist, Winston is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London and works at the Ministry of Truth.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Big Brother:</span><span> The enigmatic and all-seeing leader of the Party, Big Brother is both a symbol of the totalitarian regime and a representation of the omnipresent surveillance state. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s even alive anymore (and who knows if he even existed).</span></p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Personal Reflection:</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The end of "1984" left me feeling a mixture of sadness and contemplation. I found myself rooting for Winston until the very end, hoping that he could hold on to his hate for Big Brother. The novel is a commentary on the human condition, serving as a cautionary tale that reminds us to be vigilant in safeguarding our freedom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>One of the most heart-wrenching aspects of the story was the betrayal of Winston's love for Julia. Their relationship had been a glimmer of hope throughout the novel, a bit of humanity amidst the bleakness of totalitarian rule. But in the end, even their love is not enough to defeat the Party.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The book is largely a product of its time, reflecting the political and social climate of the mid-20th century. The novel was written in the aftermath of World War II, during the early years of the Cold War, when the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism was at its height. Many dystopian novels of that era explore themes of totalitarianism, often drawing parallels to communism or socialism.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Orwell's portrayal of an oppressive regime in "1984" can be seen as a cautionary tale against the dangers of communism. As a Cuban-American, I couldn't help but draw parallels between Winston's experience and that of my own family in Cuba, particularly in terms of isolation, animosity between citizens, and brainwashing. In both situations, people were encouraged to watch their neighbors and family members, and inform the government of any rule-breaking. I was struck by how closely this reality resembled the thought police and joycamps in the novel.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the US, I think we often take freedom for granted. "1984" serves as a stark reminder to always be vigilant in protecting our freedom, as it is a fragile and precious thing that can be easily lost. Reading this novel has made me more aware of the importance of standing up for our rights and liberties, and I hope others will feel the same way after reading it.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Recommendation:</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I highly recommend "1984". It&rsquo;s a classic that leaves you thinking about what it means to be free and to have free will. Reading "1984" will leave you with a renewed appreciation for the freedom we enjoy and a sense of responsibility to preserve it for future generations.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Unanswered Questions:</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While "1984" ties up many loose ends, it also leaves many questions unanswered, which add to the novel's sense of mystery and intrigue.</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Did O'Brien actually co-author "The Book," or was that just another example of the Party taking credit for others' work?</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>How long had the Thought Police been aware of Winston's rebellious thoughts and actions?</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Was there any hope for the proles to rise against the Party, or were they as doomed as Winston and Julia?</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Why did it seem like O'Brien could read Winston's mind, and what was the nature of their connection?</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Was Julia truly tortured and brainwashed in the end, or was she part of the Thought Police all along? I know they make it seem like she was definitely tortured in the end and possibly had a lobotomy, but there were so many suspicious things about her:</span></p>
</li>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>She knew so much about Winston from the beginning (e.g. his name, the perfume her mom used, the chocolate).</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>She asked him to read The Book aloud instead of reading it with him. It&rsquo;s as if she wanted him to be heard by the tv.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Speaking of tv, it&rsquo;s suspicious that she actually pointed out the picture frame that was hiding the telescreen. &ldquo;I bet that picture&rsquo;s got bugs behind it.&rdquo;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>O&rsquo;Brien claimed Julia betrayed him almost immediately. But when he talks to her at the end of the book she mentions going to Room 101. Weren&rsquo;t there 3 stages involved in reprogramming and torture was the last one?</span></p>
</li>
