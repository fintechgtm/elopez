<article style="margin-top: 30px;">
<p>I haven’t created a life plan in a few years. I used to do this pretty consistently, but when COVID hit it felt like a lot of stress to think about the future. I still had personal goals I&rsquo;d work toward, but nothing overly planned out. This year, I want to get back into the habit.</p>
  <p><b>My new year's resolutions for 2023:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Brand:</b> Create a personal website, publish a newsletter every 2 weeks, blog weekly, and network with 50 fintech operators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Read:</b> Read one classic book per week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fitness:</b> Do something active every day, do 40,000 push ups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Health:</b> Never eat after 8pm, drink tea daily, sleep 8 hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Finance:</b> Buy a rental property, add one income stream</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal brand</h2>
<p>Last year, I started investing in my personal brand. My goal was to start building a reputation for myself as a subject matter expert in payments. I wrote &gt;50 articles for Lithic&rsquo;s blog and started a newsletter which has gained 1100 subscribers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to double down on that this year by creating a personal website, publishing my <a href="https://fintechgtm.substack.com">newsletter</a> more consistently (every two weeks), blogging weekly (about anything, just to form a habit), and networking with 50 fintech operators.</p>
<h2>Reading list</h2>
<p>I decided to make my own version of Lex Fridman's <a href="/../reading">reading list</a>. I've adapted it a bit and added a few of my own. To help with my writing habit, I&rsquo;m going to brain dump my thoughts about the book I read that week in the <a href="/../notes">notes</a> section of my blog.</p>
<h2>Fitness</h2>
<p>During 2020, I gained a ton of weight. Maybe it was the stress, my eating habits, drinking wine on the weekends, or a mix of all three. But I hated myself so I decided to get back into shape. So far I&rsquo;ve lost about 27lbs and I&rsquo;m almost at my goal weight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year I want to try to squeeze a little fitness everywhere I go by doing something active every day and doing 40,000 push ups (like 110 per day). I had thought about doing a challenge with my Peloton, but then I sprained my ankle and had to pivot to push ups.</p>
<h2>Health</h2>
<p>I read a Twitter thread about ways to lose weight with healthy habits and it included a lot of obvious tips that I already knew, but I had totally been slacking on since becoming a dad. This year, I want to stop eating by 8pm every night, drink tea daily, and sleep at least 8 hours per day. I&rsquo;m going to give myself grace on this one because consistent is better than perfect.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>For the last few years, I&rsquo;ve had my finances on autopilot. Two times a month, my paycheck got funneled into different accounts for expenses, savings, and investments. But the economy has changed a lot over the past year (i.e. food prices are up, stock returns are down, etc.), so I&rsquo;m re-evaluating how I approach our household finances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m redoing my budget, increasing our emergency fund, and looking into diversifying my income with a rental property and an additional income stream. I don&rsquo;t know what either are going to look like right now but I&rsquo;m going to start talking to a realtor and maybe experiment with monetizing my newsletter in the future. TBD, not sure if that&rsquo;s the right move but I definitely want to make at least $5000 extra this year to dip my toes into the &ldquo;passive&rdquo; income arena.&nbsp;</p>
