    Foundation: Multi-Generational Chess in the Galactic Empire
  </h1>
</div>
<article style="margin-top: 30px;">

<p>Foundation was such an enjoyable read. I couldn't resist diving into the second book in the series, even if it meant pushing the next book on my reading list back a week. I briefly felt a little guilty about that, but the whole point of doing this one book per week challenge isn&rsquo;t to stick to a list. It&rsquo;s about discovering new and exciting stories! So I decided to lean into that.</p>
<p>I love that Asimov paints a positive spin on the dystopia genre and weaves in science, math, and psychology without making it feel academic. These concepts come to life through a multi-generational hero&rsquo;s journey packed with intergalactic traders, scientists, merchant princes, priests, and politicians.</p>
<p>At the heart of that story is Hari Seldon, the brilliant mathematician and psychohistorian who predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire and sets out to create a &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; city to preserve human knowledge and culture through the chaos. He maps out the various pivot points that will happen through the next 3,000 years and leaves vague clues to help them build the next great galactic empire.</p>
<p>The entire story revolves around those Seldonian pivot points, with each chapter explaining what&rsquo;s happening at different stages of that journey. I love that about Asimov&rsquo;s storytelling. It creates a sense of tension and intrigue that comes in waves throughout the book, switching between moments of triumph and pending doom.</p>
<p>Because of the extremely long multi-generational timeline, it&rsquo;s almost like the story is playing out in slow motion, building towards the grand finale. I&rsquo;ve heard this is similar to the Dune series, where each chapter is like a puzzle piece that reveals the big picture. I&rsquo;m excited to read that series later this year.</p>
<p>Another thing I really liked about the book were the characters, and I think Salvador Hardin was my favorite because he had a crazy ability to always stay a few steps ahead of everyone else and turn a situation to his advantage.</p>
<p>One of Hardin&rsquo;s standout moments was when his rising political rival, Sef Sermak, accused him of being too soft on King Leopold of Anacreon, who wanted to conquer the Foundation. But Hardin, being the cunning strategist that he is, had a plan that was multiple decades in the making to take down Anacreon down.</p>
<p>Hardin pretended to be vulnerable to the king's demands, playing the role of a weak leader. Meanwhile, he was secretly building up the religion he had established on the foundation, which had grown into a powerful force in Anacreon.</p>
<p>When King Leopold launched his attack, Hardin was ready. He used the religious fervor of the foundation's citizens to rally a massive defense and turn Anacreon&rsquo;s people against the king. I won&rsquo;t spell out all the details, but needless to say, Sermak was totally caught off guard by this and even ended up giving Hardin major props. What a masterclass in political strategy.</p>
<p>Overall, I loved reading Foundation and couldn't get enough of the characters and Machiavellian tactics. It's a true testament to Asimov's writing that these characters, despite being written in the 1950s, still feel relevant and captivating in 2023. I'm excited to see what happens next in the series and whether Seldon's vision of a new empire materializes.</p>
<h2>Favorite quotes from the book</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It was childish to feel disappointed, but childishness comes almost as naturally to a man as to a child.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Any fool can tell a crisis when it arrives. The real service to the state is to detect it in embryo.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;A fire-eater must eat fire even if he has to kindle it himself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I consider violence an uneconomical way of attaining an end. There are always better substitutes, though they may sometimes be a little less direct.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Since when does prejudice follow any law but its own.&rdquo;</li>
